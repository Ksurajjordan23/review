Dictionary API

The program connects to an API https://dictionaryapi.dev/ and then searches for the definition of an input entered word. You can connect your PostgreSQL via this program and create a database connection and a table to store the searched word and it's definition. It will also input a tree like structure to your table, E.g., if you use the word 'tree' it will store rows for the word 't', 'tr', 'tre', 'tree' alongside it's definition. Enjoy life!
